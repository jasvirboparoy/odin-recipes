    A risotto oozing with rich winter flavours, perfect for a
    curl-up-on-the-couch meal.

  <p>
    Risotto is a northern Italian rice dish cooked with broth until it reaches
    a creamy consistency. The broth can be derived from meat, fish, or
    vegetables. Many types of risotto contain butter, onion, white wine, and
    parmesan cheese. It is one of the most common ways of cooking rice in Italy.
    Saffron was originally used for flavour and its signature yellow colour.

  <p>
    Risotto in Italy is normally a first course served before the main course,
    but risotto alla milanese is often served with ossobuco alla milanese as a
    main course.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>50g dried porcini mushrooms</li>
    <li>1.3l chicken stock</li>
    <li>250g pack dessert chestnut mushrooms , sliced</li>
    <li>8 rashers smoked streaky bacon , chopped</li>
    <li>50g butter</li>
    <li>1 onion , finely chopped</li>
    <li>300g risotto rice (we used arborio)</li>
    <li>1 small glass white wine</li>
    <li>50g parmesan , finely grated</li>
    <li>leftover roast chicken , skinned and chopped</li>
    <li>handful parsley leaves, chopped</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Soak the dried mushrooms in 500ml boiling water for 20 mins, then drain
      the liquid into the stock. The mushrooms will have absorbed a lot of the
      liquid; you should have 1.5l in total. Chop the soaked mushrooms and add
      to the chestnut mushrooms.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make the risotto: start by frying the bacon in half the butter, then add
      the onion. When they are soft, add the mushrooms and continue to cook for
      a few mins until soft. Stir through the rice and continue as in the basic
      recipe. When you add the final ladle of stock, stir through the chicken to
      reheat. Add the chopped parsley with the Parmesan and remaining butter,
      leave to rest for a few mins, then stir through and serve.
