    <h1>Green Papaya Salad</h1>

    <h2>
      This Thai salad – called Som Tum – is a riot of fresh colours and crunchy
      textures, brought to life with a signature sour-sweet-savoury dressing
      spiked with a whack of fresh chilli
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is a salad that’s about as far as you can get from Western salads.
      No mayo! No oil in the dressing!
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s a zingy and spicy cold salad made with green papaya, a fruit which
      might be unfamiliar to most Westerners. Green papaya is simply unripened
      papaya, and has a juicy and slightly crunchy texture with a neutral taste.
      More on green papaya below, including a surprise substitution option!

      When shredded, flavour clings to the green papaya. The tangle of threads
      becomes the perfect vehicle for carrying the kaleidoscope of tastes in the
      dressing: sweetness from palm sugar, salty savouriness from the fish sauce
      and dried shrimp, fresh tang from lime, and fiery pungency from a generous
      one-two punch of garlic and chilli.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tbsp garlic</li>
      <li>6 bird eye chillies</li>
      <li>6 tbsp dried shrimp</li>
      <li>150 g palm sugar</li>
      <li>125 ml lime juice</li>
      <li>125 ml fish sauce</li>
      <li>1 cup roasted peanuts</li>
      <li>20 snake beans</li>
      <li>3 cups grape tomato</li>
      <li>500g / 4 cups green papaya</li>
      <li>1/2 cup Thai basil leave</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Crush peanuts: Place peanuts in a mortar and pestle. Pound lightly to
        break them up into largish pieces, not into powder. Transfer to bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garlic and chilli paste: Place garlic and chilli in the mortar. Pound
        into a paste. Add shrimp and pound to crush them – no need to grind them
        to a paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dressing: Stir in palm sugar, lime and fish sauce until sugar dissolves.
        Pour Dressing into a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bruise snake beans: Add snake beans to mortar (in batches if needed).
        Pound to bruise, split and soften (they are raw, so they need to be
        bashed to soften). Add to Dressing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Crush tomato: Grab handfuls of tomato, crush with your hands then add
        into the bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add papaya: Add papaya and 3/4 of the peanuts. Toss well with 2 wooden
        spoons or tongs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve immediately: Once everything is coated in Dressing, immediately
        pile up onto plates. Spoon over some dressing (there will be a bit of
        dressing still left in the bowl, that's normal). Garnish with Thai basil
        leaves, sprinkle with remaining peanuts. Serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
