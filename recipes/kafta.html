        These Lebanese minced-meat skewers are like the ultimate handmade sausages
        and they're incredibly simple. Make sure you buy the best-quality minced
        lamb and beef, or even better, mince the meat yourself. If you don't have
        metal skewers you can simply shape the mixture into patties. Great on the
        barbie, great in a pan, great in the oven, these are just great!

        Kofta or Köfte is a family of meatball or meatloaf dishes found in
        South Asian, South Caucasian, Middle Eastern, Balkan, and Central Asian
        cuisines. In the simplest form, koftas consist of balls of ground meat
        usually beef, chicken, lamb or mutton, or a mixture - mixed with spices
        and sometimes other ingredients. The earliest known recipes are found in
        early Arab cookbooks and call for ground lamb.

        There are many national and regional variations. There are also vegetable
        and uncooked versions. Shapes vary and include balls, patties, and
        cylinders. Sizes typically vary from that of a golf ball to that of an
        orange.
